7.You have two tuples containing integers. Write a Python program to concatenate the two tuples and create a new tuple with the elements from both tuples.
# Sample tuples containing integers
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)

# Concatenate the two tuples to create a new tuple
new_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2

# Print the new tuple
print("Concatenated tuple:", new_tuple)
  
Sample output:
Concatenated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
