Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints them in ascending order. However, if two or more numbers are equal, print "Numbers are not distinct.
def print_in_ascending_order(num1, num2, num3):
    if num1 == num2 == num3:
        print("Numbers are not distinct")
    else:
        sorted_nums = sorted([num1, num2, num3])
        print(*sorted_nums)

# Taking three numbers as input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Printing the numbers in ascending order
print_in_ascending_order(num1, num2, num3)

output:
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 8
Enter the third number: 3
3 5 8
