Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them.
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
    else:
        return x / y

# Taking two numbers as input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Performing arithmetic operations
print("Addition:", add(num1, num2))
print("Subtraction:", subtract(num1, num2))

output:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
Addition: 10.0
Subtraction: 10.0
Multiplication: 0.0
Division: Cannot divide by zero
print("Multiplication:", multiply(num1, num2))
print("Division:", divide(num1, num2))
