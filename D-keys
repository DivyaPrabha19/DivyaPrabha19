1. Write a Python program to create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 5 and the values are their squares.
# Create an empty dictionary
square_dict = {}

# Iterate over numbers from 1 to 5
fornum in range(1, 6):
    # Assign the square of the number as the value to the dictionary with the number as the key
square_dict[num] = num ** 2

# Print the resulting dictionary
print(square_dict)

Sample Output :
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
