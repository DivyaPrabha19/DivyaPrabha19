You are implementing a word frequency counter for a text processing application. Write a Python program to count the frequency of each word in a given text and store the results in a dictionary.
Sample Text: "This is a sample text. This text contains sample words."
Sample Output: {'This': 2, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'sample': 2, 'text.': 1, 'contains': 1, 'words.': 1}

# Get the input text from the user
text = input("Enter the text: ")

# Split the text into words
words = text.split()

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store word frequencies
word_freq = {}

# Count the frequency of each word
for word in words:
    # Remove punctuation marks from the word
word = word.strip('.,?!')
    # Convert the word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting
word = word.lower()
    # Update the frequency count for the word
word_freq[word] = word_freq.get(word, 0) + 1

# Print the dictionary of word frequencies
print("Word frequency count:")
print(word_freq)
sample output :
Enter the text: This is a sample text. This text contains sample words.
Word frequency count:
{'this': 2, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'sample': 2, 'text': 1, 'contains': 1, 'words': 1}
